# Unsupervised Machine Learning for Customer Market Segmentation
Apply PCA and k-means clustering ML algorithm to train data and obtain the optimal number of clusters

Objectives: 
1. Obtain the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
2. Use sckit-learn library to find the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
3. Apply k-means using scikit-learn to perform customer segmentation
4. Apply PCA technique to perform dimensionality reduction and data visualisation
